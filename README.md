# EEG Preprocessing & Models

This repository contains code for **EEG data preprocessing** and **training machine learning models** on the processed data.

## Repository Structure
- `preprocessing_data/` – scripts for cleaning and preparing EEG data and scripts for generating visualizations of model results
- `models/` – scripts for feature extraction, model implementation, and training  
  - trained models include **LDA** and **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)** from the `scikit-learn` library
